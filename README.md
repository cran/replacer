<font font_family="courier new">`replacer`</font>, a value replacement
utility currently based on package
[<font family="courier">`data.table`</font>](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table),
is intended for outside-database update of data. It requires the
preparation of a *lookup* file which is a list of replacement *requests*
with and, in special circumstances, without an *index* column.

This utility is accessible to beginners to `R` and facilitates complex
dataset updates with minimal prompt time by employing User-friendly
functions which automatically follow a decision tree rooted in Userâ€™s
input.

Data processing such as data cleanup, file format conversion and the
appendage of new data to data files are outside the scope.

## Installation

You can install the released version of replacer from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("replacer")
```

## Example

Below is a basic example which shows the screen result of data
replacement using a lookup file without index:

``` r
require(replacer)
#> Loading required package: replacer
## basic example code
dir = system.file('extdata', package = 'replacer')
## update the 'data' dataset with new replacement values
replaceVals(dir, save = FALSE) 
#> 
#> reading data from: C:/R/R-4.1.2/library/replacer/extdata...
#> data reading complete ...
#> checking standard columns in lookup ...
#> starting replacements ...
#> found duplicates and simple replacements but no index in lookup :
#> 
#>  would recommend User-made index
#> proceeding any way ...
#> subsetting lookup and creating index ...
#> found request for 1:1 replacements: proceeding ...
#> completed 1:1 replacements ...

#> searching for 1:many replacements ...
#> found request for multiple duplicated value replacments: creating index ...
#> replacing multiple duplicated values ...
#> found request for multiple missing value replacements: replacing ...
#> processed 1:many replacements ...
#> there are still missing values in some involved columns!

Familiarity with basic `R` commands is necessary. Familiarity with
`data.table` is not, yet strongly recommended!
